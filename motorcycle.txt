We love to anthropomorphize our means of conveyance... give them names, attribute quirky characteristics to them, talk to them as if they can actually hear us... It's human to look for the humanness in other things around us, in the things we make sometimes in part of our own image. And it is in our mechanical machines that we invest so much of our efforts. It's hard not to be a little in awe of the simple complexities of our machines that were born of our cleverness and desire to create. Somewhere between the horse drawn cart and the self driving cars of today lies my 1974 Honda CB360. In my head it rolls, it conveys, it consumes, it breaths... It does have electronic components, but no circuit boards. It does have gears, and I have to shift them. It might move forward, but only if I roll the throttle and giggle a little at how cool that feels... All the "thinking" done in the engine is mechanical. It is just complex enough that I am overwhelmed by my 170 page shop manual and all the systems it describes, and just simple enough that wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers, and hammers will be most of the tools I need to make it run again...
